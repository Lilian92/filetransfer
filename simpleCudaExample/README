-----Problem:
Cuda_prog_1

-----Platform tested:
Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
gcc version 6.3.0
GUN Make 4.1

-----GPU:
Tesla P100-PCIE-16G

-----Run:
$make clean
$make
or
$make USE_FAST_MATH=1 #For '-use_fast_math' compilier option
$./cuda_prog_1 4 1
#'4' above presents the 4th version of code, we have 1, 2, 3, 4 versions of code.
#Defoult value is '1'. The versions map to the optimizations step by step
#'1' above presents whether doing correctness testing by running the basic version's code to compare to test.
#Defoult value is '0'. So we can chose '0' to not do the test

-----Optimizations:
1>. avg run time: 0.409645 ms; Basic version
2>. avg run time: 0.110410 ms; Reorginize the block and grid setting as <256, 1>, <dimx*dimy/256, 1> to change
                               data mapping and optimize memory access. And also reduce index calculation.
3>. avg run time: 0.071187 ms; For each thread, process 2 continious elements, to avoid branch with in warp
4>. avg run time: 0.069136 ms; Using "float4" data type to optimize data access
5>. avg run time: 0.065920 ms; Add "use_fast_math" in the compilier option
